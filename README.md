# .NET MAUI Summer Coding Adventure
Join us on an exciting Summer Coding Adventure as we dive into the enchanting world of .NET MAUI app development! We will build a .NET MAUI application that will display a list of refreshing recipes that you can prepare and enjoy during warm weather. We will start by building a basic app that presents a couple of recipes and that you can share with your friends. We will then improve the UI design. We will also see how to obtain data from a RESTful endpoint and add our own recipes to the app, which will be stored locally in the device.
